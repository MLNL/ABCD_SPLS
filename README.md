# ABCD_SPLS project

This repository holds all the code and relevant download links with further code and data required to replicate the recently submitted paper "Voxel-wise sparse multivariate analysis of adolescents’ brain and psychosocial data yields six modes of covariation in cognition and psychopathology" by

Rick A Adams\*, Cemre Zor\*, Agoston Mihalik, Konstantinos Tsirlis, Mikael Brudfor, James Chapman, John Ashburner, Martin P Paulus & Janaina Mourão- Miranda.
\*equal contribution

Because of the amount of scripts as well as the space required, we decided to add everything to a server and only leave the toolkit as well as some instructions on Github.
So everything else other than the toolkit can be found in [here](http://www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/ABCD_SPLS/).
After downloading everything on the server, one should first open the two README documents found in there.

All the step-by-step information is contained within these two documents.
- *README_preprocessing_github* contains all the information regarding the prepocessing of the brain data and the psychosocial data used.
- *README_main_github* contains all the information regarding all the analyses, figures and tables found in the main paper as well as the Supplement.
One should also read the Supplement, together with the main paper, as some information is described in greater detail there.


## Toolkit & other libraries used

- We used a custom-built version of the CCA/PLS Toolkit found [here](https://github.com/MLNL/cca_pls_toolkit). If one wants to replicate our analyses one should use the custom-built version of the toolkit found here, since otherwise most scripts will fail to run.
- We also used a list of other libraries, all of which can be found in our server link mentioned above.
